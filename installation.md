# Installation

The implementation is based on the high-order finite element library [NGSolve](https://ngsolve.org). 
For details on the installation and troubleshooting we refer to the various `NGSolve` installation tutorials [NGS24](https://docu.ngsolve.org/ngs24/intro.html) or the [NGSolve Documentation](https://docu.ngsolve.org/latest/).

To run the `*.ipynb` examples you additionally need an installation of [jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install).

Moreover the python packages `matplotlib` and `numpy` are used.
