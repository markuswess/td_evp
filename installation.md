# Installation

The implementation is based on the high-order finite element library [NGSolve](https://ngsolve.org) which can be installed using

```
python -m pip install numpy scipy matplotlib jupyter ipyparallel scikit-build
python -m pip install --upgrade ngsolve webgui_jupyter_widgets
```
For troubleshooting and more details on the installation we refer to the various `NGSolve` installation tutorials [NGS24](https://docu.ngsolve.org/ngs24/intro.html) or the [NGSolve Documentation](https://docu.ngsolve.org/latest/).

To run the `*.ipynb` examples you additionally need an installation of [jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install)
